Represents a push-button widget for Android, similar to Button, allowing the user to show a badge with text in the a corner of the view (inspired on iOS).
Typical uses would include showing the number of notifications under a screen.
The implementation uses badge_button.xml, which can be customized to choose the badge corner (default is top|right),
the badge itself, between badge1 or badge2, as well as the text font, size, color and typeface.
It is advised, for the button property layout_margin="5dip", that the image is around 25x25 px.

The badge initializes hidden.

The test activity BadgeButtonTestActivity exemplifies how to quickly set up a dashboard with buttons and buttons with badge.
